# Abstract

## Research Question
The study investigates the effects of "Ban the Box" (BTB) policies on employment outcomes, particularly whether they reduce racial disparities or inadvertently encourage racial discrimination.

## Key Findings
- The results confirm that criminal records significantly hinder employment prospects, as employers were 63% more likely to call back applicants without a record.
- However, BTB policies increased racial discrimination, with the black-white callback gap widening from 7% before BTB to 43% after its implementation.

# Introduction

## BTB

**Ban the Box (BTB)** is a policy that prohibits employers from asking about an applicant’s criminal history on initial job applications or in interviews, aiming to improve employment opportunities for individuals with criminal records, particularly Black men.

| **Theoretical Benefits of BTB**                        | **Theoretical Concerns of BTB**                        |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Increases employment opportunities for individuals with criminal records, particularly Black men. | Employers may rely on racial stereotypes in the absence of criminal record information, potentially harming Black applicants without records. |

## Data

- **Sample Size**: Nearly 15,000 fictitious online job applications were submitted.  
- **Target Jobs**: Entry-level positions.  
- **Applicant Characteristics**: Young male applicants with randomly assigned racial identities (Black or White) and felony conviction status.  
- **Geographic Scope**: New Jersey and New York City.  
- **Time Period**:  
  - **New Jersey**: Pre-BTB (January 31 – February 28, 2015) and Post-BTB (May 4 – June 12, 2015).  
  - **New York City**: Pre-BTB (June 10 – August 30, 2015) and Post-BTB (November 30, 2015 – March 31, 2016).  
- **Outcome Measure**: Callback rates (whether the employer contacted the applicant for further steps).  

## Research Questions Explored Through Experimental Design  

1. **Impact of Race and Criminal Record on Callbacks**  
   - Examines whether employer callback rates differ based on an applicant's race and felony conviction status.  

2. **Effect of BTB on Racial Disparities in Callbacks**  
   - Assesses how removing criminal history questions from job applications affects the racial gap in employer callbacks.  

3. **Triple-Differences Analysis**  
   - Compares changes in racial disparities over time at BTB-affected employers versus employers whose application process remained unchanged.  

4. **Additional Applicant Characteristics**  
   - Investigates whether having a **GED instead of a high school diploma** or a **one-year employment gap** signals a criminal record to employers.  

5. **Statistical Discrimination vs. Stereotyping**  
   - Tests whether employers' responses align with rational statistical discrimination or if they rely on exaggerated racial stereotypes about criminality.  

## Key Findings  

1. **Criminal Records Are a Major Barrier to Employment**  
   - Applicants without felony convictions were **63% more likely** to receive callbacks compared to those with convictions.  

2. **BTB Increases Racial Discrimination**  
   - The **black-white callback gap widened** significantly at BTB-affected employers, increasing from **7% before BTB to 43% after BTB**.  
   - When controlling for trends at unaffected employers, the disparity grew to **45%**.  

3. **Disproportionate Effects on Different Groups**  
   - **Black applicants without records** experienced a **decline in callback rates** after BTB.  
   - **White applicants with records** saw a **substantial increase in callbacks**, while Black applicants with records did not.  

4. **Limited Impact of Other Applicant Characteristics**  
   - Neither **having a GED** instead of a high school diploma nor **an employment gap** significantly affected callback rates, either before or after BTB.  

5. **Employers Likely Rely on Stereotypes Rather Than Rational Statistical Discrimination**  
   - Employers **overestimate racial differences in felony conviction rates**, contributing to increased racial disparities post-BTB.  
   - Despite GED status being a stronger real-world predictor of criminal records than race, **employers did not use it as a proxy**.  

## Contributions to the Literature  

1. **First Experimental Study on BTB’s Effects**  
   - Provides **the first field experiment** examining the impact of Ban the Box (BTB) policies.  
   - Adds empirical evidence to an area with **limited prior research**, complementing observational studies.  

2. **Advances Research on Statistical Discrimination and Stereotyping**  
   - Uses **field experimental methods** to analyze how employers substitute criminal record checks with racial assumptions.  
   - Contributes to the understanding of **statistical discrimination versus stereotype-driven decision-making**.  

3. **Methodological Innovation in Audit Studies**  
   - Extends the **audit study method**, traditionally used for **one-time discrimination assessments**, to evaluate **policy changes**.  
   - Combines **field experiments with quasi-experimental difference-in-differences analysis**, enhancing causal inference.  

# **Randomization and Experimental Design in the Study**  

The study employs a **randomized controlled trial (RCT) approach** within a field experiment to isolate the causal effects of Ban the Box (BTB) policies. The key aspects of randomization are as follows:  

1. **Random Assignment of Applicant Characteristics**  
   - Each fictitious job applicant was **randomly assigned**:  
     - A **racial identity** (Black or White) using distinctively Black- or White-sounding names.  
     - A **felony conviction status** (either having or not having a criminal record).  
     - Additional characteristics such as **GED versus high school diploma** and **employment gap presence**.  

2. **Pairwise Application Submission**  
   - Applications were sent in **matched pairs** to the same job posting, ensuring that:  
     - Each employer received one Black and one White applicant.  
     - Other attributes (besides race and conviction status) were held constant within each pair.  

3. **Temporal Randomization (Before vs. After BTB Implementation)**  
   - The study capitalized on **policy timing variation**, submitting applications **both before and after** BTB laws went into effect in:  
     - **New Jersey** (March 1, 2015).  
     - **New York City** (October 27, 2015).  
   - This design allowed the researchers to estimate **pre-post differences** while controlling for broader labor market trends.  

4. **Comparison Across Affected and Unaffected Employers**  
   - Some employers already **did not ask about criminal records before BTB**, creating a **natural control group**.  
   - The study used a **triple-differences approach** (difference-in-differences-in-differences, DDD) to compare:  
     - Employers **forced to remove** the criminal record question due to BTB.  
     - Employers **who never asked** about criminal records, serving as a baseline comparison.  

## **Triple-Differences Approach (DDD) Explained**  

The **triple-differences (difference-in-differences-in-differences, DDD) approach** is an **extension of the standard difference-in-differences (DID) method**, designed to control for **confounding factors** and strengthen causal inference.  

**1. Standard Difference-in-Differences (DID)**
DID compares **two groups** (treatment vs. control) **before and after** a policy change to estimate its causal effect. However, if other external factors change over time, DID may still capture **non-policy-related effects**.  

**2. Triple-Differences (DDD) in This Study**
The study refines DID by introducing a **third level of comparison**:  
- **First Difference**: Callback rate difference **before vs. after BTB** for employers affected by the policy.  
- **Second Difference**: Callback rate difference **before vs. after BTB** for employers **not affected** (who never asked about criminal records).  
- **Third Difference**: Subtracts the second difference from the first, isolating the true **BTB effect** by removing trends that affected both groups.  

**3. Why Use DDD?**
- Controls for **time trends** affecting both treatment and control groups.  
- Removes **baseline racial disparities** in hiring that existed before BTB.  
- Identifies how **BTB uniquely impacted racial discrimination** beyond general hiring trends.
